# HashMap-Python
- Currently supports addition of any elements. Functions exactly as built-in Python Dictionary.
- Deletion of any elements.
- Dynamic resizing.
- Rehashing functionality.

To make better:
- Currently collision resolution is done through creating new buckets, but there could be some smarter way of reutilizing the already existing buckets.
